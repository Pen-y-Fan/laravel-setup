The package is currently under development. 

The concept: 
1. Create a new laravel project as normal `laravel new project-name`.
2. Require this package, as a dev dependency, to automatically install code quality and static analysis tools along
 with basic configuration files for the Laravel project.

## Installation

**Once developed**, the plan is you can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require -dev pen-y-fan/laravel-setup
```

## Usage

The plan is to automatically run the required script, when initially required:

1. Run a default installation of each of the static analysis and code quality tools, including helpers
2. Copy a default configuration file, phpstan.neon and esc.yml, for each tool.
3. On Windows create a batch files (details below)

The code quality, static analysis and testing tools being planned are:

* PHPStan with  phpstan.neon and 
* Easy Coding Standard (ECS)
* PHPUnit (normally already included with Laravel)
* PHP CodeSniffer (optional to ECS)

The **composer.jason** will have the following added:

```json
{
    "require-dev": {
        "phpstan/phpstan": "^0.12",
        "phpunit/phpunit": "^8.5.0",
        "squizlabs/php_codesniffer": "^3.5.3",
        "symplify/easy-coding-standard": "^7.1",
        "symplify/phpstan-extensions": "^7.1",
        "nunomaduro/larastan": "^0.5.0",
        "phpstan/phpstan-phpunit": "^0.12.2"
    },
    "scripts": {
        "checkcode": "phpcs src tests --standard=PSR12",
        "fixcode": "phpcbf src tests --standard=PSR12",
        "test": "phpunit",
        "tests": "phpunit",
        "check-cs": "ecs check src tests --ansi",
        "fix-cs": "ecs check src tests --fix --ansi",
        "phpstan": "phpstan analyse app tests --ansi --error-format symplify"
    }
}
```

### Windows batch files

On Windows OS batch files to allow scripts to be easily run from the command line will be added to the project root.
 Similar to the bash alias.

#### `pu.bat`

Will run the script `composer test`, which will run all tests using phpunit

#### `cc.bat`

Win run the script `composer check-cs`, which will run easy-coding-standard, no code will be altered.

#### `fc.bat`

Win run the script `composer fix-cs`, which will run easy-coding-standard with the fix switch.

#### `ps.bat`

Win run the script `composer phpstan`, which will run static analysis using PHPStan.

#### Manually run phpcs

To run PHP CodeSniffer.
 
To check code to PSR-12 extended coding style:

**TODO**: Find Laravel coding style

```bat
composer checkcode
```

To fix code to PSR-12 extended coding style:

```bat
composer fixcode
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```

## TODO

Plans for the future development of the project. Static analysis and code quality tools are abbreviated to **tool**

- [ ] Create a proof of concept for a new Laravel project with static analysis and code quality tool and basic config
 files.
  - [ ] The installer will examine the composer.json and automatically install the tool based on the package's PHP
   version.
  - [ ] Allow the latest version of the tool to be installed, which may force a newer PHP version
- [ ] Create an artisan command line tool to up issue the required tools or install different tools.
- [ ] Expand the concept to other frameworks (Symfony, Slim, CodeIgnite, vanilla (other)) with their basic config files
- [ ] Expand the concept foe existing projects, which may already have some tools, but may want to standardise.
- [ ] Add more choice of tools and configs: Psalm, Phan, PHP Insights, Rector. PHP Code Style Fixer (PHP CS Fixer)
  - [ ] Automatically set the level for static analysis, start at level 0 and increase until errors are found.
